# React-Query

React Query is often described as the missing data-fetching library for React, but in more technical terms, it makes fetching, caching, synchronizing and updating server state in your React applications a breeze.

## Installation


``` 
$ npm i react-query
# or
$ yarn add react-query 
  ```
